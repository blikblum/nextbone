# Introduction

Nextbone is a conversion of venerable [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) using modern Javascript features. It also replaces the View layer by a set of utilities to integrate with Web Components.

## Features

- Keeps Backbone features / behavior with minimal changes. _In fact, most of the code is untouched_
- Uses EcmaScript Modules and Classes
- Fully tree shackable
- Seamless integration with Web Components (specially [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/))
